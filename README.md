# WAYSER

## Description
"Your service right on the way"

Wayser is an online platform in which potential service providers can create their own profile and publish their service without intermediaries (e.g. french teacher, plumber, baby-sitter...). Users interested in acquiring a specific service can also create a profile, search for the service and contact the provider. If an agreement is reached, the user acquires the service.

## User Stories
